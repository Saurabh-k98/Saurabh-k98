## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a results-driven Python developer with a strong foundation in backend engineering, data structures, and applied machine learning. I focus on building scalable and maintainable systems through clean, modular code, and have hands-on experience in developing RESTful APIs, automating workflows, and working with cloud-native tools.

I also work with **Power BI**, **Databricks**, **Snowflake**, and **WhizAI** to build data pipelines, analyze large datasets, and deliver meaningful business insights. Proficient in **SQL** and consistently refining my DSA skills, I aim to bring a balanced mix of system-level thinking and data-driven problem-solving to every project I undertake.
